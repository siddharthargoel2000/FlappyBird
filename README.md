Play Flappy Bird by actually flapping your hands.

Notes
---
* Does _not_ work in Firefox. Works well in Chrome.
* Sound must be on and maximized. You may hear the high-pitched tone it uses. Best to use built-in laptop speaker.
* Microphone access must be allowed. It listens to the change in the tone to detect motion.
* Flap your hand toward your microphone. On Macbook it is by top-left of the keyboard. You may have to Google where it is on your computer.
* The speaker or microphone on some computers may not be able to handle the 20kHz tone used for the doppler detection.
